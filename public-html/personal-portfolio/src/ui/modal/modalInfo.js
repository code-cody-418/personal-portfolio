    description: "With the Navajo Nation I rebuilt a website, conducted a data transfer, built a Help Desk application, and maintained VM infrastructure. WIth the website, I used modern styling techniques to create a mobile responsive site using the Bootstrap library. Also, old hard coded data was converted to display dynamically and a search algorithm was added that could filter job data. On the other hand, I successfully transferred over 2 million documents from an old database to a new one. This was done using the extraction, transformation, and loading methodology. The data was extracted into CSV format, transformed using JavaScript, and then loaded using the database CMS gui."

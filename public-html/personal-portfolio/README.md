# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo

This Portfolio was built by utilizing webgl on the browser. When I learned that 3d websites could be created I quickly began coding to try it out! The primary library I used was React-Three-Fiber, but I quickly found my self knee deep in React and three.js documentation. Hope you find the info your looking for about me and if you want feel free to message me to learn more.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

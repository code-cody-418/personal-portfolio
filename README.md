# Welcome to my Portfolio Repo

- This Portfolio was built by utilizing webgl on the browser. When I learned that 3d websites could be created I quickly began coding to try it out! The primary library I used was React-Three-Fiber, but I quickly found my self knee deep in React and three.js documentation. Hope you find the info your looking for about me and if you want feel free to message me to learn more.
